Border Neighbours Threat Index is an index that analyzes countries' news and classify if they are negative.

That Python program firstly pulls news from RSS feeds of each country's news websites.
It is based on TÃ¼rkiye's BNTIndex so therefore there are Iran, Iraq, Greece, Egypt, Syria, Bulgaria, Russia, Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Armenia.
I am planning to add more countries' BNTIndex, it is an initial version.
